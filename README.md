# Spotify Data Analysis Project

## Motivation
This project aims to explore my Spotify listening data to uncover patterns in my music preferences, genre trends, and how audio features correlate with track popularity. Understanding these patterns can provide insights into personal habits and broader music trends.

## Data Source
- **Spotify API**: Used to fetch listening history and audio feature data for tracks.
- **Personal Data**: Extracted from Spotifyâ€™s data export feature.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Collection (Complete)**:
   - Used Spotify Web API to collect data.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze listening habits (e.g., most played genres, artists, and tracks).
   - Explore time-based trends (daily/weekly listening patterns).

3. **Audio Feature Analysis**:
   - Examine features like tempo, energy, valence, and danceability.
   - Correlate audio features with track popularity.


 ## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **API**: Spotify Web API
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
